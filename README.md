# Memory-Games
The "Memory Games" web app allows users to choose between two small games to play. Upon opening the web app, users are presented with two buttons: one for the "Memory Card Game" and another for "Guess the Number". Clicking on either button redirects the user to the corresponding game page, where they can enjoy the selected game.
